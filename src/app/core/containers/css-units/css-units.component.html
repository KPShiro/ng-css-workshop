        <h1>Absolute length units</h1>
        <p>
            The following are all absolute length units â€” they are not relative to anything else, and are generally
            considered to always be the same size.

        <p>
            Relative length units are <span class="text-yellow-500">relative to something else</span>, perhaps the
            size of the parent element's font, or the size of the viewport. The benefit of using relative units is
            that with some careful planning you can make it so the size of text or other elements scales relative to
            everything else on the page.
