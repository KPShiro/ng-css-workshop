            The following are all absolute length units ‚Äî they are not relative to anything else, and are generally
            considered to always be the same size. Most of these units are more useful when used for print, rather than
            screen output. For example, we don't typically use cm (centimeters) on screen.

            Relative length units are relative to something else, perhaps the size of the parent element's font, or the
            size of the viewport. The benefit of using relative units is that with some careful planning you can make it
            so the size of text or other elements scales relative to everything else on the page.

        Do I really need all of them?
    </h2>

    <div class="prose dark:prose-invert">
        <p>
            The short answer is... in most cases, you don't üòÅ During your day-to-day work you will need just a few
            relative units, and sometimes, pixels. The rest of them can be usefull in quite rare or very specific cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember these units:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>px</li>
            <li>em, rem</li>
            <li>vh, vh</li>
            <li>vmin, vmax</li>

        The Pixel Unit
    </h2>

    <div class="prose dark:prose-invert mb-4">
        <p>
            What is the pixel unit? Most probably, during the research, you will find very different definitions. Some
            of the sources will define it as a "measurement that never changes", some as "non linear-angular
            measurement" and others as "pixel density of the device".
        </p>
        <div class="bg-blue-600 w-[96px] h-[96px] flex items-center justify-center">
            <span class="text-center font-bold">96px</span>
        </div>
        <p>
            The square above should be 1 inch x 1 inch (96px x 96px). If you compare the size of it on 2 different
            devices (e.g. your computer and smartphone), you will easily see that there is a difference. Also, measured
            with a ruler it will not match as well. But why is that? Isn't the pixel unit absolute?
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, it is all related to the anchor unit. For print, CSS will apply the same rules known to you, so
            1cm on the printed page is exactly 1cm. The situation changes for electronic devices (like tv, notebook, and
            smartphone...). Because of a different expected viewing distance, there is a difference in the <a

        <code>em</code> & <code>rem</code> units
    </h2>

    <div class="prose dark:prose-invert mb-4">
        <p>
            Both <code>em</code> and <code>rem</code> units are categorized as being relative units that are relative to
            the font size. In the case of the <code>em</code> unit, it is relative to the font size of the element it is
            assigned to, unless it is assigned to the <code>font-size</code> property, in which case it will be relative
            to the font
            size of the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>rem</code> instead of being relative to the font size of the parent, it is being relative to the font
            size of the root element. Root element is the <code>html</code> element, which has by default font size of
            16px (or rather 100% font size of native browser settings).
